BOLT EARNINGS ANALYSIS PROJECT 
I worked on analyzing Bolt ride earnings using a year’s worth of data (from 2022–2023). Despite the limited dataset, I focused on extracting meaningful insights such as:
✅ Gross vs Net Income
✅ Monthly Commission Trends
✅ Top 3 and Least 3 Profitable Months
✅ Overall Income Trend
📊 Tools Used: Excel (Power Query + Data Visualization)
🔍 Challenge: One of the tricky parts was formatting the timeline to show a continuous year transition from 2022 to 2023
